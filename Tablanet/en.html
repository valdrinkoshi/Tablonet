<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>
<div>Tablanet is a turn-based card game. You can play only one card at each turn.</div>
<div>Your card can collect the table cards that match its number or sum to its number (e.g. your "5" can take all the "5", "2+3", and "4+1" on the table)</div>
<div>The number of <b>A</b> can be 1 or 11, <b>J</b> is 12, <b>Q</b> is 13, and <b>K</b> is 14.</div>
<div>Watch out with <b>A</b>: if there are 2 <b>A</b> on the table, you can take them either with <b>J</b> (11+1) or <b>2</b> (1+1)</div>
</p>
